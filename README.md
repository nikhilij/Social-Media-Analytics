# Social Media Analytics Web Application

## Overview
This project is a *Social Media Analytics Web Application* built using *Vite + React* for the frontend. It is designed to provide real-time insights into user engagement on a social media platform.

   - Posts appear in descending order (newest first).

4. *Responsive Design*
   - Ensures compatibility across desktop and mobile views.
   - UI built with *Tailwind CSS* for styling.

5. *API Integration*
